# Imperative
When we use imperative, we need to be careful with verb aspects. For example,
- Izvolite, uđite u kuću (perfective)
- Ulazite u kuću (imperfective)
Usually, we should use the perfective aspect, which is polite and "traditional". The imperfective form is used in case we are angry for example.

# Perfective after modal verbs

After modal verbs like moram, hoću, mogu, treba, etc, we always use the perfective aspect.
Perfective aspect in present tense: the verb is never alone, it always has a complement or something.
